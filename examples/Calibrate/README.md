## Calibrating your ESCs

Calibration means that when your input (e.g., throttle stick) is in its max
position, you'll be sending the maximum pulse with of 250 uSec to each ESC, 
and when your input is at its minimum 125uSec pulse width.
The Calibration sketch allows you to do this, using either the sort of
potentiometer shown in the video, or the more common method of and R/C 
transmitter/receiver.
