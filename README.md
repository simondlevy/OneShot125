This a simple, header-only C++ library for using a 
[Teensy](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/)
microncontroller board to run brushless motors via an electronic speed
controller (ESC) supporting the popular
[OneShot125](https://oscarliang.com/oneshot125-esc-quadcopter-fpv/) protocol.  I adpated the code from
Nicholas Rehm's awesome
[dRehmFlight](https://github.com/nickrehm/dRehmFlight) repository, with the goal of allowing
fellow Teensy lovers to use this kind of ESC in other projects.
